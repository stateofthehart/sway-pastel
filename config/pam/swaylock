#%PAM-1.0
# Swaylock PAM - password OR fingerprint (both work independently)
# Place this file at /etc/pam.d/swaylock
#
# How it works:
# - Type password + Enter → unlocks immediately
# - Press Enter (blank), then use fingerprint → unlocks
# - Either method works independently!

# Try password first (with likeauth to allow fallback)
auth       sufficient   pam_unix.so try_first_pass likeauth nullok

# Try fingerprint
auth       sufficient   pam_fprintd.so

# Deny if neither worked
auth       required     pam_deny.so

account    required     pam_unix.so
password   required     pam_unix.so try_first_pass nullok shadow
session    required     pam_unix.so
